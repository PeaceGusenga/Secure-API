Objective:
The objective of the test is to validate the security measures implemented in the API and ensure that unauthorized access is restricted.
The focus will be on authentication mechanisms, authorization checks, encryption, and any other security-related features.

Scope:
The scope of the testing will cover the secure endpoints of the API.
Testing will include various scenarios related to authentication and authorization.

Test Approach:
The test approach will be to simulate different authentication scenarios, including valid and invalid tokens, to ensure that only authorized access is granted.
Authorization checks will be performed to verify that users are granted appropriate permissions based on their roles.
Encryption and secure communication protocols will be tested to ensure data integrity and confidentiality.

Test Environment:
The test environment will include the Reqres API for the secure endpoints.
The testing will be performed using JavaScript code in Visual Studio Code.

Test Cases:
Test Case 1: Valid Authentication - Send a request with a valid token and verify successful access to the secure endpoint.
Test Case 2: Invalid Authentication - Send a request with an invalid token and verify access is denied.
Test Case 3: Authorization Check - Verify that users with different roles can access only the endpoints they are authorized for.
Test Case 4: Encryption - Verify that the API endpoints use secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS) to ensure data integrity and confidentiality.

Test Data:
Test data will include valid and invalid authentication tokens, user credentials, and roles for authorization checks.

Test Execution:
The test cases will be executed using the JavaScript code in Visual Studio Code.
Test results and any observed issues or failures will be logged and reported.
